# Ferrostar Core

Ferrostar is a modern SDK for building turn-by-turn navigation applications.

The Ferrostar core includes the navigation state machine, common business logic, spatial algorithms, and models. 

If you're porting Ferrostar to a new platform or want to build your own UI from scratch, you're in the right spot.

Refer to the [Ferrostar User Guide](https://stadiamaps.github.io/ferrostar/)
for info and tutorials on the high-level UI + wrappers available for common platforms.
